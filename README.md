# Forecasting with Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to this data analysis and forecasting repository! This project uses Python in Jupyter Notebook to go through essential steps for a complete data analysis pipeline, from data preprocessing to model creation, forecasting, and dashboard preparation. Each notebook is designed to be clear and actionable, allowing easy exploration of each analysis stage.

## Repository Structure

Here’s an overview of the notebooks included:

1. **01_pre_processing.ipynb**  
   - Preprocess raw data for analysis.
   - Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
   - Outputs a ready-to-analyze dataset.

2. **02_descriptive_statistics.ipynb**  
   - Explore the dataset with descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize key metrics and identify trends.
   - Gain insights into data distribution and key characteristics.

3. **03_modeling.ipynb**  
   - Build and evaluate predictive models.
   - Covers model selection, training, validation, and performance metrics.
   - Aims to create robust models ready for forecasting.

4. **04_forecast.ipynb**  
   - Generate forecasts based on the models created.
   - Implement predictive techniques to forecast future data trends.
   - Provides visualization of forecast results.

5. **05_dashboard_prep.ipynb**  
   - Prepares final data and visualizations for a dashboard.
   - Structures data outputs for easy integration with visualization tools.
   - Ensures insights are accessible and actionable.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you’ll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository_name.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each notebook can be run sequentially for a comprehensive data analysis pipeline. 

1. Start with `01_pre_processing.ipynb` to clean and prepare data.
2. Follow with `02_descriptive_statistics.ipynb` to explore the dataset.
3. Move on to `03_modeling.ipynb` for model training.
4. Use `04_forecast.ipynb` to generate future forecasts.
5. Finish with `05_dashboard_prep.ipynb` to prepare final data visualizations.
